# AI Explanation Layer

This folder contains the AI-assisted explanation system for NBABot.

## Purpose

The AI layer exists **only to explain picks generated by deterministic logic**.
It does not generate picks, predict outcomes, or influence confidence scores.

## Responsibilities

The AI layer:
- Converts structured data into human-readable explanations
- Explains historical insights and risk context
- Supports learning and transparency

The AI layer does NOT:
- Select players
- Predict results
- Generate odds
- Modify confidence or risk values

## Model

- Primary Model: GPT-4.1-mini
- Usage: Explanation only
- Temperature: Low (to reduce speculation)

## Fallback Behavior

If AI services are unavailable or credits are exhausted:
- The system automatically falls back to a rule-based explanation engine
- No functionality is lost
- No user-facing errors occur

## Design Principle
